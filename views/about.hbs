  <h1>About the opportunity data dashboard</h1>
  <p>
    <a href="https://www.openactive.io/">OpenActive</a> is a community-led initiative using open data to help people get
    active.
    The opportunity data dashboard lists all of the openly licensed datasets and APIs published as part of the
    OpenActive initiative.
  </p>
  <p>
    Opportunity data is about where and when sport and physical activities happen. For example, when and where
    a yoga class or group run is taking place.
  </p>
  <p>
    Using the opportunity data feeds, you can harvest data about sporting and physical activities from across the UK.
    This data is made available for anyone to access, use, and share under an open licence. You are free to use the data
    to help build new products and services, for example to help people discover opportunities to be more physically
    active.
  </p>
  <p>
    The dashboard provides an overview of which datasets are available, which data publishers
    support <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/openactive/">the OpenActive standards</a>.
